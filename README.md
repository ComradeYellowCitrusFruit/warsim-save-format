# The Warsim File Format!
##### Or if not used for Warsim the Lemon16-85 File Format
Here is this the brand fuckin new Lemon16-85 file format  
It is made to be a savefile format/under filesystem filesystem for Discount Warsim however with can be used for whatever the fuck you want  
The name is derived from the Base16 to Base85 binary encoding process it uses (16-85) and it's creator, me (Lemon)
